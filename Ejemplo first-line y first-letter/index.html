 <p>They dined on heaping platters of Szechuan chicken, of
 spicy beef, of shrimp and vegetables in some exotic dish
 without a name. Bits of food were passed from chopsticks
 to chopsticks, violating all known laws of Chinese
 cuisine etiquette. The tea flowed hot and fast that night,
 until the meal finally concluded itself.</p>
 <p>"Thank you for dining here tonight," said the badgeless,
 anonymous waitress. She placed a small tray containing the
 check and two wrapped fortune cookies on the edge of the
 table, and hefted the empty plates one by one, forming a
 stack on the crook of her elbow.</p>
 <p>"Absolutely delicious," declared Oliver as he pulled a card
 from his wallet and flicked it onto the bill. He picked up
 the two cookies, an afterthought. "Fortune cookie, my
 love?" he asked Amanda.</p>
